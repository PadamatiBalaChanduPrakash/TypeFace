Designing a Datastore for monitoring data of a service:
     Datastore must be designed for providing strong consistency on the APIs. So for creating effecient datastore choose the best console like Google cloud console.  Create Entity pages based on the entities required in our application such as response time of API and type of requests, error percentages etc.,. Use Namespacing for describing entities and specify the task of each entity for storing the information of different forms. Add properties for each fields and create a datastore by clicking create option. After creating datastore we can apply queries on data by clicking on run query .Run query can be observed by  either by selecting Query by Kind or Query By GQL Tab. The following queries can be applied on created datastore by using run query tab. They are 1.)Get the API with maximum average response time across the users. 2.)Get the API with maximum average response time for each user. 3.)Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours.When calling either one of them, Datastore will flush all pending updates on one of the replicas and index tables, then execute the lookup or ancestor query. Thus, the latest entity value, based on the updated index table, will always be returned with values based on the latest updates. In a large application with millions of users or terabytes of Datastore entities, it is possible for inappropriate usage of Datastore to lead to deteriorated consistency. They are Sequential numbering in entity keys and Too many indexes. So they must be avoided in early stage of designing the application. However, they maynot effect large applications.
